 research problem and objectives

Public-health interventions strive to spare individuals and communities from the burden in infectious disease poses on humanity. Designing effective policies is an intricate task. Infectious disease epidemics are complex phenomena that results from the interaction between pathogens, individuals, environment and societies, and only scarce and biased information is available.  Modeling offers a principled way to deal with the available evidence to reason infectious disease dynamics, which in turn allow for informed control decisions.



compartmental models, diversity of models.

The present thesis tackles selected infectious disease modeling topics with the aim of helping decision-makers to design effective policies. 

%Your methods
A set of five modeling st of infectious disease transmission is proposed, each covering a different facet of the spread and control of disease.
Two mInitially focused on cholera, one of humanity's earliest disease, still present in many part of the world,  Model are used as representation of reality to 

The emergence of covid-19 in 2019 diverted the initial research plan focused on cholera, and we present modeling work , bridging the gap between science.


The final application of these model is within an optimal control framework, where algorithms designs the most effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation strategy
